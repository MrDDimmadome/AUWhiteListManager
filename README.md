# AUWhiteListManager
This is a work in progress. 

Attempting to create a discord bot that can manage Among Us lobbies via whitelist managed by this bot.
Idea is to kick anyone from the lobby that is not on the whitelist.

Not sure if this is yet possible, making the repo public for collaboration purposes.

Reason for project: Due to the ease of hacking Among Us via IL2CPP Hacking, I wanted to give discord servers the ability to prevent unwanted players from entering a private lobby.
